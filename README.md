# Password-Vault
The purpose of this project is to create a simple and user friendly interface for people to store their passwords in a secure manner. Password requirements are now much more strict than they used to be. This includes length, numbers, and symbols in order to make these passwords less likely to get breached. Also, users should never use the exact same passwords for several different accounts. This means that it is much more difficult for people to remember credentials for the many accounts we use such as zoom, social media, academics, and online banking to name a few. A great solution for this issue is to create a password vault where a user can easily and securely store an organized list of these passwords to ensure that these will not be forgotten. We must solve the problem at hand and then decide as a group how we will complete this project given the time frame and different tasks at hand. This will summarize the different solutions and techniques that we can use to solve this problem in an efficient manner as a group. At the end of this project we will arrive at a user friendly software that we can add features to and eventually implement after testing.
